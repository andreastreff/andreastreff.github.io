         A Little Bit About Me</h2>
					</header>
					<content>
						<p>Mining your marketing data and analytics to help you learn more about who your customers are and what they want from you is my specialty. A former “jack of all trades” marketer, I use my background and expertise in direct, online and inbound marketing to help businesses bridge the gap between their marketing analytics and marketing strategy and tactics.</p>
				<h2>My Background</h2>
						<p>I work as a consultant supporting businesses large and small, for profit and non-profit with Tech SEO, Analytics and Conversion Rate Optimization at Elementive. I am curious, creative and cunning when it comes to helping our clients address technical website issues and helping them understand how to utilize their data to increase engagement and conversions..</p>
            <p>I love what I do. Each day I get the privilege to work with businesses of all shapes and sizes with missions ranging from improving the lives of children to helping people plan their dream vacations to connecting businesses with the information, workforce and skills they need to succeed. </p>
            <p>While each client is widely varied in their mission, they all have a similar goal of delivering an extraordinary experience and product to their customers. We get to help our clients achieve that goal by improving the technical performance of their websites (like speed, errors and mobile), setting up custom configurations of Google Analytics and evaluating customer conversion paths.</p>
            <p>None of this would be possible if it wasn't for a conversation back in 2014 when Matthew and I started talking about going into business together. We had worked together for almost 5 years he as my consultant and me as his client and we knew that together we could build a business we would both be proud of and so was born Elementive. </p>
            <p>While we have evolved even in the last 4 years, the core of what we do and deliver has remained the same. We are dedicated to helping business with analytics, technical SEO, and conversion optimization. Also, at the heart of who we are, both as individuals and a business, is we are teachers. We want to share what we know with others and are always trying to learn from other experts to improve what we do.</p>
